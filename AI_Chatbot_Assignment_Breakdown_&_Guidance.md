# AI-Powered Chatbot Order Status Service: Assignment Breakdown & Guidance

---

## Part 1: User Stories & MVP Definition

**Goal:** Define 4â€“5 clear user stories for your chatbot users.

**Content:** Each story includes:  
- Persona (e.g., online shopper, customer support agent)  
- Story statement (what the user wants to do)  
- Benefit (why it matters)  
- Acceptance criteria (conditions to meet)  
- Mapped REST endpoint (e.g., GET /orders/{id})

**Deliverable:** A user-stories.md file.

## Part 2: Project Kick-off & Scaffolding

**Goal:** Bootstrap your Node.js/Express web service.

**Tasks:**  
- Generate directory structure  
- Create sample routes  
- Write basic README.md  
- Commit code with meaningful AI-generated commit messages

**Deliverable:** Git repository with initial scaffold.

---

## Part 3: Authentication & Session Management

**Goal:** Implement secure user registration and login.

**Tasks:**  
- Create endpoints: POST /users/register, POST /users/login  
- Issue JWT or session cookie after login  
- Protect /chat endpoint with auth middleware

**Deliverable:** Auth endpoints and secured /chat.

---

## Part 4: Building the Core Chat API

**Goal:** Implement /chat endpoint integrated with LLM (Large Language Model) API.

**Features:**  
- Accept user messages  
- Return polite, customer-focused AI replies  
- Handle errors and rate limits gracefully

**Deliverable:** Authenticated /chat endpoint working with AI.

## Part 5: Simulating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

**Goal:** Enhance chatbot replies with relevant product knowledge base (KB) context.

**Tasks:**  
- Create JSON/YAML KB of FAQs or product documentation  
- Implement retrieval logic to fetch relevant KB entries at query time  
- Append retrieved context to the LLM prompt

**Deliverable:** Code showing retrieval and example contextual chats.

---

## Part 6: Automated Testing

**Goal:** Create unit/integration tests.

**Tasks:**  
- Mock LLM, authentication flows, and retrieval logic  
- Cover positive and negative cases (invalid login, missing auth header, unknown queries)

**Deliverable:** Test suite runnable via npm test or pytest.

---

## Part 7: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

**Goal:** Automate build, test, and deployment.

**Tasks:**  
- Create CI config (e.g., GitHub Actions) to checkout code, install dependencies, run tests, build Docker image, and push to a registry

**Deliverable:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` or equivalent.

---

## Part 8: Cloud Deployment & Environment Configuration

**Goal:** Deploy containerized chatbot to cloud.

**Tasks:**  
- Use Kubernetes manifests or serverless definitions (AWS Lambda + API Gateway, etc.)  
- Configure environment variables for API keys and KB path  
- Validate live /chat endpoint URL (authenticated access)

**Deliverable:** Deployment configs and live endpoint link.

---

## Bonus Extensions

- Swap JWT for OAuth2 or SSO integration.  
- Implement front-end chat widget with login and chat sessions.  
- Add observability features: logs, metrics, health check endpoint.
